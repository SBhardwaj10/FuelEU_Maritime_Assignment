# Backend Reflection

## Design Choices
- Used hexagonal architecture for maintainability
- Isolated business logic from Express and DB
- Used TypeScript strict mode for safety

## Challenges
- Mapping business rules to DB schema
- Handling edge cases in pooling logic
- Ensuring test coverage for all use-cases

## Improvements
- Add more integration tests
- Automate DB migrations in CI
- Document API contracts

# Project Reflection

## What Went Well
- Hexagonal architecture kept business logic clean and testable
- AI agent (Copilot) accelerated code generation and refactoring
- Modern UI with Tailwind improved usability
- Incremental commits tracked progress clearly

## Challenges
- Port conflicts during dev server startup
- Ensuring backend seed data matched KPIs
- Handling edge cases in banking/pooling logic

## Lessons Learned
- Strict separation of core and adapters simplifies testing
- Automated agent workflows save time but require validation
- Early setup of ESLint/Prettier prevents style drift

## Next Steps
- Add more frontend unit tests
- Expand backend integration tests
- Enhance accessibility and mobile responsiveness
