# Backend Reflection

## Design Choices
- Used hexagonal architecture for maintainability
- Isolated business logic from Express and DB
- Used TypeScript strict mode for safety

## Challenges
- Mapping business rules to DB schema
- Handling edge cases in pooling logic
- Ensuring test coverage for all use-cases

## Improvements
- Add more integration tests
- Automate DB migrations in CI
- Document API contracts
